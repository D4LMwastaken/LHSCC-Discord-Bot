# D4LM's Largo High School Coding Club Discord Bot
A Discord Bot integrated into the Largo High School Coding Club's Discord Server. Actively helps the club run, ultimately allowing people like me (D4LM) avoid overwork by sending some of the workload to this Discord Bot.

## Why do I need D4LM's LHSCC Discord Bot?
One of the problems that I have with running a club that is very small is nobody will distribute the workload. For example, my sponsor for my club deos not play a huge role in the club. 

These issues can be mitigated by finding a new sponsor and/or forcing others to do more work. This usually will lead to the collapse of the club very quickly.

Other fixes such as retiring is not an option for me as I am not a senior & the Coding Club will collapse due to lack of leadership.

Given all the above, I needed a simple tool that would reduce my workload & save some time & resources, but allow others to run the club still. That's how D4LM's Largo High School Coding Club Discord Bot was born.

Please note: I would not recommend installing other Discord Bots as this one has many features that could conflict with other Discord Bots.

One bot that does not conflict with D4LM's LHSCC Discord Bot **as of right now** is Crypt's Discord Bot.
