# D4LM's Largo High School Coding Club Discord Bot
A Discord Bot integrated into the Largo High School Coding Club's Discord Server. Actively helps the club run, ultimately allowing people like me (D4LM) avoid overwork by sending some of the workload to this Discord Bot.

## Showcase:

## TODO
* Add stuff to README.MD such as instructions to run & install...
* Add a way for the Discord bot to greet people who join the Discord Server
* Add a way for the Discord bot to say goodbye to people who leave the Discord Server.
* Allow a way for it to create events...
