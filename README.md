        experienced coder(They all should understand Python).
* Recommended OS: Windows(Preferably 10 or 11), Linux (Preferably Ubuntu), MacOS
    * Note for Windows users: I will not be helping you for related Windows issues, as although I am a expert on Windows,
        I do not recommend running this for server-side because of Windows Kernel memory issues and that overall,
        Windows is bad for coding and programming compared to Linux. I would recommend Linux distros over Windows.
    * Note for MacOS users: I am not an expert on MacOS so please don't ask me about issues not related to the code 
        but is software/hardware specific, please Google it...
    * Note for Linux users: If you have issues please check your distro's forums and search for answers. 
        You are smart/mature enough to fend for yourselves.
    * Minimum specifications: Very little, you can probably run it on a potato PC. 
        All you need is probably 10mb/s internet connection.
    * Steps for Ubuntu 22.04(For other Linux Distros or other Ubuntu versions,
        check their documentation on how to use Python):
        1. Create two enviormental variables, one for Gemini API Key and another for your Discord Bot API Key.
